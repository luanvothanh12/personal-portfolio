Sony WH-XM4 is my main headphones for coding, designing, video editing, and everything else. I absolutely love my Sony WH-XM4 headphones. The sound quality is simply outstanding, making every coding session an immersive experience. Whether I'm listening to music or tuning into a podcast, the audio is always crystal clear.

What I appreciate the most is the noise-cancelling feature. It's incredibly effective at blocking out background noise, allowing me to concentrate fully on my work. This is especially useful when I'm working in a noisy environment.

Comfort is another big plus. The soft ear cushions and adjustable headband make it easy to wear these headphones for hours on end without feeling any discomfort. This is crucial for me, as I often find myself coding for long stretches of time.

The latest model [WH-1000XM5](https://amzn.to/3xckUSV) looks absolutely cool though, I often carry it when I go to a cafe and am still happy with it.
