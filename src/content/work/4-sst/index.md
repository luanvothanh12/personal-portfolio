## Overview

The SST board is a RMIT’s School of Science & Technology’s homegrown project, designed and programmed by a group of 4 IT students. The idea stems from wanting SST to have a unique and special feeling, like a small family. The board is made up of laser-cut mica boards, more than 3000 programmable LEDs, precise soldering, a Teensy development board and, to cap it off, a strong power supply to drive everything and make it portable. With careful and manual LED mapping, beautiful animations and patterns can be displayed on the board. Not just ourselves, this project is the culmination of work from both the teaching staff and the technicians from the school and other students as well. We hope with this project, more students can be more active and out-spoken with their ideas as we had before.

## Working Process

- Design the board with a CAD program. Calculate the total surface area and derive the amount of LEDs needed.

- Cut the board with a laser cutter.

- Carefully cut the LED strips, align and stick them onto the board.

- Carefully solder the LED strips together. Hook up the LEDs with the Teensy and connect everything to the power supply

- Map out the LEDs and program the Teensy, using C++.
