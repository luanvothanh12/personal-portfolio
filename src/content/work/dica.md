## Overview

The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly significant in the field
of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in recent years due to its remarkable use in instruction
understanding and human-like response generation. They have proven to be highly utilised in both
academic and practical applications in healthcare. As the technology behind LLMs continues to evolve,
their impact on society and industry is potential in further development, making them an increasingly
important area of research and development.

This collaborative initiative, undertaken in partnership with the Oxford University Clinical Research
Unit (OUCRU), is focused on the development of a Large Language Model (LLM) machine learning
system. The primary objective of this project is facilitate the development of a web portal incorporating
a LLM designed to engage in contextual discussions concerning Dengue-related topics and other general
medical issues.

To achieve this, the proposed LLM will undergo fine-tuning using a diverse array of medical data
sources. The aim is to equip it with the capability to offer pre-diagnostic information and provide
feedback to users in a manner that closely emulates human-like interaction. The efficacy of the model
will be evaluated based on its ability to proficiently handle question-answering tasks while ensuring
comprehensibility. The outcomes have demonstrated a notable success, as the fine-tuned models have
outperformed the base model across a range of key evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, as part of an effort to enhance user accessibility and engagement, this project includes the
development of a dedicated website portal featuring a chat interface. This interface will seamlessly
integrate with the proposed LLM model, resulting in an improved and user-friendly experience for
individuals seeking Dengue-related medical information.
