MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) is my main computer for app devs, designing, video editing, and everything else.
It's so powerful and really a good foundation to create digital stuff. It will stay with you regardless of how far you wanna go, how crazy you want to experiment whatever. And bonus: It's portable!

So, I can enjoy coding wherever like at cafes, hotels, and even in nature :) Pretty awesome.
It would have not been possible to film coding videos in nature like this, thanks to its high power efficiency.
