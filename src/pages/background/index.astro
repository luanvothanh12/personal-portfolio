					My passion for AI ignited when I delved into courses on Artificial Intelligence offered by
					Microsoft and MITx. These courses provided me with a comprehensive understanding of this
					captivating field of modern Information Technology. My specific interest in AI revolves
					around natural language processing, a branch of Deep Learning. Since then, delving deeper
					into NLP and Semantic Analysis has been a burning desire, driven by my aspiration to make
					a meaningful impact on social issues through the application of deep learning and
					Artificial Intelligence. Doctor Lex Fridman, one of the lecturers in the Deep Learning
					video course from MIT, has been a significant source of inspiration in my journey.

				<p class='mb-2'>
					As a machine learning engineer, my focus is on leveraging AI technologies to develop
					innovative solutions that address real-world challenges. I am particularly passionate
					about pushing the boundaries of AI research and development to create intelligent systems
					that can understand and interact with human language in a more natural and meaningful way.
				</p>

				<p class='mb-2'>
					My academic background in literature has instilled in me a unique perspective and
					appreciation for language, which I believe enhances my ability to work in the field of
					natural language processing. Combining my passion for AI with my expertise in machine
					learning, I am committed to advancing the field and contributing to its continued
					evolution.
				</p>

				<p class='mb-2'>
					The convergence of technology and business presents exciting opportunities for innovation
					and growth. As a machine learning engineer, I am keen to explore the intersection of AI
					and business, seeking to develop AI-driven solutions that drive business growth, improve
					efficiency, and enhance decision-making processes.
